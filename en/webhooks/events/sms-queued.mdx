description: "Webhook fired when an SMS is accepted and queued for delivery."

## Overview

The `sms.queued` event is sent when Rewrite accepts an SMS request and places it into the outbound delivery queue.

This is typically the first lifecycle event for a message and is useful to:

- Confirm API request acceptance asynchronously
- Track queue throughput and latency
- Start delivery SLAs from a consistent point

## Example payload

```json
{
  "type": "sms.queued",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-14T19:41:12.126Z",
  "id": "393821034567832123",
  "data": {
    "id": "733501234567890123",
    "to": "+5511999999999",
    "status": "QUEUED",
    "provider": null,
    "metadata": {
      "campaign": "onboarding-2026",
      "tenantId": "acme-01"
    }
  }
}
```

## Event object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | `string` | Event identifier. For this page: `sms.queued`. |
| `id` | `string` | Unique webhook event id. Use for idempotency/deduplication. |
| `createdAt` | `string` (ISO-8601) | Timestamp when Rewrite created the event. |
| `data` | `object` | SMS resource snapshot at queue time. |

## `data` object

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | Unique SMS id in Rewrite. |
| `to` | `string` | E.164 recipient phone number. |
| `status` | `string` | Current SMS status (`QUEUED`). |

## Recommended handling

1. Validate the webhook signature.
2. Persist raw payload + event id.
3. Mark message as queued in your DB.
4. Return `200` quickly and process asynchronously.

<Info>
You should treat webhook delivery as at-least-once and make processing idempotent.
