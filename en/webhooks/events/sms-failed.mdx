title: "sms.failed"
description: "Webhook fired when an SMS fails permanently and will not be delivered."

## Overview

The `sms.failed` event is emitted when delivery cannot be completed and the SMS reaches a terminal failure state.

Typical reasons include:

- Invalid or unreachable destination numbers
- Carrier/provider rejection
- Routing constraints
- Policy or quota violations

2. Persist payload for support/audit visibility.
