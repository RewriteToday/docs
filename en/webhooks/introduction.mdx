description: "Use **Rewrite** webhooks to receive real-time SMS events in your application."

## What are webhooks?

Rewrite webhooks are **real-time HTTPS POST requests** sent to your server whenever something important happens in **Rewrite** — like an SMS being delivered, failing, or being scheduled.

Instead of polling the API, webhooks let your app react instantly with a **JSON** payload.

### When should you use webhooks?

- **Delivery tracking** - Mark messages as delivered/failed without polling
- **Customer workflows** - Trigger onboarding, alerts, and verification flows
- **Data retention** - Store events in your own Database for analytics/reporting
- **Reliability** - Detect provider issues and automate retries

## Webhook flow at a glance

<Steps>
	<Step title="Creating an endpoint" titleSize="h3">
		You need to create an HTTP endpoint in your app (ex: `/webhooks/rewrite`).
		
		```ts server.ts
		export const app = new Elysia()
			.post('/webhooks/rewrite', ({ body }) => {
				console.log({ body });
				
				return { success: true };
			});
		```
	</Step>
	<Step title="Registering the endpoint" titleSize="h3">
		You register that URL in the **Rewrite dashboard** (And select event types).
	</Step>
	<Step title="Receiving events" titleSize="h3">
		Your server receives events as they happen.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Confirming delivery" titleSize="h3">
		Your server confirms delivery by responding with **HTTP 200**.
	</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Your endpoint must be publicly reachable over HTTPS in production.
During development, use a tunnel like **ngrok** or **Cloudflare Tunnel**.
</Info>

## Receiving webhooks locally

<Steps>
	<Step title="Create a dev endpoint" titleSize="h3">
		Here's a minimal examples using **Node.js**.
		
		<CodeGroup>
		
		```ts Elysia
		import { Elysia } from 'elysia';

		const app = new Elysia()
			.post('/webhooks/rewrite', ({ body, query: { signature } }) => {
				// 1) verify signature (recommended)
				// 2) persist the event (recommended)
				// 3) process it (queue/job recommended)
				
				return { success: true };
			});
			
		app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Listening on 3000'));
		```
		
		```ts Express
		import express from 'express';

		const app = express();
		
		app.use(express.json());

		app.post('/webhooks/rewrite', (req, res) => {
		  const { body } = req;

		  // 1) verify signature (recommended)
		  // 2) persist the event (recommended)
		  // 3) process it (queue/job recommended)
				
		  res.status(200).send({ success: true });
		});

		app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Listening on 3000'));
		```
		</CodeGroup>
		
		<Info> For local testing, expose your server to the public internet using: - **ngrok** - **Cloudflare Tunnel** - **VS Code Port Forwarding** </Info>
	</Step>
	
	<Step title="Register the webhook in Rewrite" titleSize="h3">
		In the **Rewrite dashboard**:

		1. Add your public HTTPS URL
		2. Select the event types you want
		3. Save
		
		You can also manage webhooks programmatically via the [API](../api) or [SDK](../sdks).
	</Step>
	
	<Step title="Trigger any event" titleSize="h3">
		Send a message, delete one, and watch them arrive.
		
		You'll receive a JSON payload similar to:
		
		```json
		{
			"type": "sms.delivered",
			"createdAt": "2026-02-14T19:41:12.126Z",
			"id": "393821034567832123",
			"data": {
				"id": "733501234567890123",
				"to": "+5511999999999",
				"status": "DELIVERED",
				"provider": null,
				"metadata": {
					"code": "923721"
				}
			}
		}
		```
	</Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices (do this early)

<CardGroup cols={2}> <Card title="Verify signatures" icon="shield" color="#C9CBD1"> Always validate the webhook signature to ensure the event was sent by Rewrite. </Card> <Card title="Ack fast, process async" icon="bolt" color="#C9CBD1"> Return HTTP 200 quickly and process work in a queue/job to avoid timeouts. </Card> <Card title="Be idempotent" icon="repeat" color="#C9CBD1"> Webhooks may be retried. Use event IDs to ignore duplicates safely. </Card> <Card title="Persist raw payloads" icon="database" color="#C9CBD1"> Store events for audit/debugging and to rebuild state if needed. </Card> </CardGroup> <Warning> If your endpoint returns a non-2xx response or times out, Rewrite may retry delivery. Design your handler to be **idempotent**. </Warning>
