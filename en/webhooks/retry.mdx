# Retries & Replays

\- Understand how **Rewrite** guarantees webhook delivery — and what happens when your endpoint fails.

When **Rewrite** sends a webhook event, your server **must respond with `HTTP 200 OK`** to confirm successful delivery.

If your endpoint does not return a `2xx` status code (or times out), the delivery is considered **failed** and **Rewrite** will automatically retry it.

---

## Automatic Retries

Rewrite uses **exponential backoff with capped retries** to ensure reliable delivery without overwhelming your infrastructure.

Each webhook event is retried according to the following schedule:

| Attempt | Delay After Previous Failure |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| 1        | Immediately                  |
| 2        | 5 seconds                    |
| 3        | 1 minute                     |
| 4        | 5 minutes                    |
| 5        | 15 minutes                   |

After the final attempt, the webhook is marked as **permanently failed**.

---

### Example

If your endpoint fails the first three attempts but succeeds on the fourth:

- Attempt 1 → immediate (fails)
- Attempt 2 → +5s (fails)
- Attempt 3 → +1m (fails)
- Attempt 4 → +5m (success)

The total time from the first attempt to successful delivery would be approximately **6 minutes and 5 seconds**.

---

## When Do Retries Stop?

Retries stop when:

- Your endpoint returns a **2xx response**
- The maximum retry limit is reached
- The webhook endpoint is deleted or disabled
- The event expires (TTL reached)

---

## Best Practices

To avoid unnecessary retries:

- Always return `200 OK` as soon as you receive the event
- Process heavy logic **asynchronously**
- Use idempotency (store event IDs and ignore duplicates)
- Implement request timeout under 10 seconds

Example minimal handler:

```ts
export async function webhookHandler(req, res) {
  const { body } = req;

  // Immediately acknowledge
  res.status(200).end()

  // Process asynchronously
  queue.push(body)
}
```

## Manual Replays

If a webhook fails permanently — or if you need to reprocess an event — you can manually replay it.

You can replay both:

- `failed` deliveries
- `successful` deliveries (useful for debugging)

## How to Replay

1. Go to the **Webhooks** section in the **Rewrite Dashboard**
2. Select your webhook endpoint
3. Open the event you want to replay
4. Click **Replay**

**Rewrite** will resend the exact same payload to your endpoint.

## Idempotency Reminder

Manual replays and automatic retries may deliver the same event multiple times.

You should:

- Store processed event IDs
- Ignore duplicates
- Ensure your system behaves safely on repeated deliveries

## Delivery Guarantees

Rewrite provides:

- At-least-once delivery
- Ordered delivery per message (when applicable)
- Signed payload verification
- Delivery visibility in dashboard
