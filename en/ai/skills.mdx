Rewrite Skills are reusable capability packs for AI agents.
They define focused workflows, reusable instructions, and implementation patterns so teams can ship faster with predictable quality.

## Typical skill structure

<Accordion title="1. Scope and intent">
  Define exactly what the skill owns and when it should be triggered.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Execution workflow">
  List the sequence of actions: discovery, implementation, validation, and handoff.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Guardrails">
  Add non-negotiables such as safety checks, style constraints, and prohibited operations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. Reusable assets">
  Include scripts, templates, and references to reduce manual repetition.
</Accordion>

## Best practices

- Keep each skill narrowly scoped to one outcome.
- Prefer concrete steps over broad generic instructions.
- Add validation criteria so success is measurable.
- Version and evolve skills as your codebase and tooling change.
- Link each skill to real workflows used by your team.
