description: Understand quotas, PAYG pricing, plan behavior, and limit handling for Rewrite API usage.

# Overview

Usage limits define how traffic is admitted, billed, and protected in Rewrite.

This page explains:

- How request and sending quotas work
- PAYG billing model
- Plan-based quotas and upgrades
- What happens at limit boundaries
- Operational best practices

  <Card title="Quota model" icon="gauge" color="#C9CBD1">
    Limits are applied to protect platform stability and keep delivery quality high.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Billing model" icon="coins" color="#C9CBD1">
    Billing can follow PAYG pricing or plan-included quota depending on workspace setup.

    Request pressure is controlled with API rate limiting and retry hints.

## Billing modes

<Tabs sync={false}>
  <Tab title="PAYG">
    PAYG is billed per SMS sent.

    **Price:** `0.20` per SMS (as configured by Rewrite commercial policy).

    This model is best for variable traffic or early-stage workloads.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Plans">
    Plans include predefined quota and commercial terms.

    Current plan tiers, included volume, and overage behavior are published at:

## Quota dimensions

| Dimension | What it controls | Typical signal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API request rate | Request burst/throughput to API endpoints | `429` + retry headers |
| SMS send volume | Total send capacity by billing mode | Dashboard usage counters |
| Plan quota window | Included volume in plan cycle | Plan usage status |

## What happens when you hit limits

- API pressure may return `429` with retry hints.
- New sends can be blocked once commercial quota is exhausted.
- Behavior depends on billing mode and workspace policy (PAYG vs plan).

## Rate-limit headers to read

When rate limited, inspect:

- `X-RateLimit-Global`
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`
- `X-RateLimit-Retry-After`
- `Retry-After`

If multiple retry hints are present, use the most conservative wait time.

## Quota-friendly architecture patterns

    Buffer outbound traffic and drain with controlled concurrency.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use idempotency" icon="repeat" color="#C9CBD1">
    Prevent duplicate SMS during retries and partial failures.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backoff + jitter" icon="timer" color="#C9CBD1">
    Retry transient failures gradually to avoid synchronized spikes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Segment traffic" icon="split" color="#C9CBD1">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Practical policy recommendations

1. Set internal soft limits before hard quota boundaries.
2. Alert when usage reaches 70%, 85%, and 95% of the window.
3. Reserve budget for high-priority use cases (e.g., OTP).
4. Auto-throttle lower-priority campaigns during pressure.
5. Keep dead-letter queues for sends that exceed policy limits.

## Monitoring checklist

- Track `429` rate per endpoint and environment.
- Track send success, failed, and undelivered ratios by region.
- Track cost per use case (`otp_login`, `alerts`, `marketing`).
- Reconcile internal counters with provider/webhook outcomes.
- Review quota incidents weekly and tune throttling policy.

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Where do I see current plan values and quotas?">
  Use the official pricing page: [rewritetoday.com/pricing](https://rewritetoday.com/pricing).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I combine plan usage and PAYG behavior?">
  Commercial behavior depends on workspace configuration. Check your active billing setup in account settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the safest retry behavior under limit pressure?">
  Retry only transient failures, respect retry headers, and apply exponential backoff with jitter. See [Errors & retries](/en/api/errors).
