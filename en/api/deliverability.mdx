# Overview

Deliverability is the probability that a message is accepted by carriers and reaches the recipient device in a useful time window.

At Rewrite, deliverability is treated as a continuous loop between send quality, route quality, and event feedback.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Routing quality" icon="route" color="#C9CBD1">
    Route decisions are continuously evaluated by destination and health signals.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Policy safety" icon="shield-check" color="#C9CBD1">
    Content and sending behavior are tuned to reduce filtering and complaints.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Retry control" icon="rotate-cw" color="#C9CBD1">
    Retries are bounded and idempotent for transient failures only.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feedback loop" icon="webhook" color="#C9CBD1">
    Delivery events are used to suppress bad destinations and improve future sends.

</CardGroup>

## How Rewrite delivery works

1. Request validation and normalization
2. Provider and route decision
3. Dispatch and carrier handoff
4. Webhook feedback ingestion
5. Application policy updates (suppression, retry, escalation)

## Deliverability pillars

<Tabs sync={false}>
  <Tab title="List hygiene">
    - Send only to valid E.164 numbers.
    - Remove destinations with repeated hard failures.
    - Suppress opt-out users immediately.
    - Avoid stale or recycled-number-heavy lists.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Content quality">
    - Keep copy clear and expected.
    - Identify brand early in message text.
    - Avoid spam-like patterns (deceptive links, all caps, punctuation abuse).
    - Keep transactional and OTP copy short and precise.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sending behavior">
    - Avoid abrupt volume spikes on new routes.
    - Ramp gradually by country/use case.
    - Retry only transient failures with backoff + jitter.
    - Respect user timing windows.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Compliance">
    - Keep consent evidence where required.
    - Include opt-out instructions when required by regulation/use case.
    - Separate transactional and promotional traffic.
    - Follow regional constraints for sender/template rules.
  </Tab>

## Valid webhook event types for deliverability

Use only supported event types in your monitoring and automation:

- [`sms.queued`](/en/webhooks/events/sms-queued)
- [`sms.delivered`](/en/webhooks/events/sms-delivered)
- [`sms.scheduled`](/en/webhooks/events/sms-scheduled)
- [`sms.failed`](/en/webhooks/events/sms-failed)
- [`sms.canceled`](/en/webhooks/events/sms-canceled)

Reference: [Webhook Event Types](/en/webhooks/types)

## Reducing bad outcomes

| Outcome | Typical cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `undelivered` | Carrier filtering, unreachable handset, route stress | Improve content safety, validate destination quality, retry with policy |
| `failed` | Invalid destination, policy rejection, hard downstream error | Classify as permanent/transient, suppress permanent |
| Delayed delivery | Congestion, route pressure | Use bounded retry and latency SLO monitoring |
| Complaint/opt-out spikes | Irrelevant traffic or frequency | Tighten segmentation and frequency controls |

## Content playbook (high impact)

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Brand first" icon="badge-check" color="#C9CBD1">
    Put brand or product context in the first 20-30 characters.
  </Card>
  <Card title="One CTA" icon="mouse-pointer-click" color="#C9CBD1">
    Keep a single clear action and avoid competing instructions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trusted links" icon="link" color="#C9CBD1">
    Use stable domains and avoid low-reputation shorteners.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Localized copy" icon="languages" color="#C9CBD1">
    Use [i18n](/en/api/i18n) with a robust fallback message.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Retry policy for deliverability

Retry only when failure is likely transient:

- `429` and transient `5xx`
- temporary provider timeout
- temporary route saturation

Do not blind-retry permanent validation/policy failures.

Implementation baseline:
- idempotency key per logical send
- exponential backoff + jitter
- max attempt cap
- dead-letter queue for manual inspection

## Throughput warming strategy

1. Start with controlled regional volume.
2. Increase gradually while monitoring delivery and complaints.
3. Keep separate streams for OTP and promotional-like traffic.
4. Pause ramp-up when failure ratios worsen.

## Webhook-driven optimization loop

1. Ingest webhook events in near real time.
2. Persist normalized payloads.
3. Update recipient health and suppression state.
4. Alert on threshold breaches.
5. Adjust routing and policy for next sends.

## Practical payload for analytics-ready sending

```json
{
  "to": "+15551234567",
  "message": "Rewrite: your verification code is 123456",
  "i18n": {
    "pt-BR": "Rewrite: seu codigo de verificacao e 123456"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "use_case": "otp_login",
    "tenant": "acme-app",
    "campaign": "auth-v1",
    "template_version": "v3"
  }
}
```

Use `metadata` to segment deliverability by region, use case, and template version.

## Deliverability checklist

- Validate E.164 before send.
- Enforce consent and suppression rules.
- Keep copy clear, short, and brand-identified.
- Use [i18n](/en/api/i18n) with safe fallback.
- Retry only transient failures via [Errors & retries](/en/api/errors).
- Track outcomes by region/provider/use case.
- Auto-suppress permanent-failure destinations.
- Review failure taxonomy weekly and tune policies.
