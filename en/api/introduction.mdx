# Overview

The Rewrite API lets you send and manage SMS with predictable, production-friendly behavior.

This page covers:

- Base URL and versioning model
- Authentication via `Authorization: Bearer ...`
- Request/response conventions
- Links to limits, quota, retries, and pagination guides

    All requests go to `https://api.rewritetoday.com`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Versioning" icon="arrows-left-right" href="#versioning" color="#C9CBD1">
    Use the path version prefix (`/v1`) for stable integrations.

  <Card title="Auth" icon="key" href="#authentication" color="#C9CBD1">
    Send your API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.

## Base URL

Use this host for all API endpoints:

```text
https://api.rewritetoday.com
```

Example create-message endpoint:

```text
https://api.rewritetoday.com/v1/messages
```

<Info>
Use HTTPS only. Do not send API keys over insecure channels.
</Info>

## Versioning

Rewrite versions endpoints in the URL path.

Current documented version:

- `v1`

Versioning rules:

- Backward-compatible updates can happen within the same version.
- Breaking changes ship under a new version path.
- Keep the version explicit in all hardcoded endpoints.

## Authentication

Authenticate every request with a secret API key from your Rewrite dashboard.

Expected header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer rw_...
```

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.rewritetoday.com/v1/messages" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rw_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "+15551234567",
    "message": "Your OTP code is 123456"
  }'
```

<Warning>
Never expose secret API keys in browser/mobile client code. Keep them server-side.
</Warning>

## API conventions

- `Content-Type`: use `application/json` for JSON payloads.
- Phone format: use E.164 (example: `+15551234567`).
- Errors: non-2xx responses return structured error payloads.
- Limits: high request pressure can return `429` with retry headers.
