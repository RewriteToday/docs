## Before you start

- You need to have Golang installed on your machine.
- You need to have a Rewrite API key with the permissions.


<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the SDK" titleSize="h3">
        To install the Golang SDK, run the following command:
        
        ```bash
        go get github.com/rewritestudios/go
        ```
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Set up REWRITE_API_KEY environment variable" titleSize="h3">
    Set up your Rewrite API key in your environment variables.
    
    ```text .env    
    REWRITE_API_KEY=rw...
    ```
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Send your SMS" titleSize="h3">
    Now, all you need to do is pass the message content and that's it!
    
    ```go main.go
    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "github.com/rewritestudios/go"
    )

    func main() {
        rewrite := rewrite.New("rw_abcxyz")

        data, error := rewrite.Messages.Send(&rewrite.Messages.SendOptions{
            To:      "+1234567890",
            Message: "Your OTP code is 478201",
        })

        if error != nil {
            fmt.Println(error)
            
            return
        }
        
        fmt.Println(data)
    }
    ```
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Interact with the API" titleSize="h3">
      You can also interaction with the API with the SDK methods
      
      ```go webhooks.go
      package webhooks
      
      import (
        "github.com/rewritestudios/go"
      )
      
      func Create(name, url string) {
        rewrite := rewrite.New("rw_abcxyz")
        
        data, error := rewrite.Webhooks.Create(&rewrite.Webhooks.CreateOptions{
          Name: name,
          Events: []string{"sms.delivered"},
          URL: url,
        })
        
        if error != nil {
          fmt.Println(error)
          
          return
        }
        
        fmt.Println(data)
      }
      ```
      You can do everything with our SDK, keep exploring!
