## Before you start

- You need to have Golang installed on your machine.

        ```bash
        go get github.com/rewritetoday/go
        ```
    </Step>

    Set up your Rewrite API key in your environment variables.
    
    ```text .env    
    REWRITE_API_KEY=rw...
    ```

    <Step title="Send your SMS" titleSize="h3">
    Now, all you need to do is pass the message content and that's it!
    
    ```go main.go
    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "os"
        "github.com/rewritetoday/go"
    )

    func SendSMS(to string) (any, error) {
        client := rewrite.New(os.Getenv("REWRITE_API_KEY"))

        data, err := client.Messages.Send(&rewrite.Messages.SendOptions{
            To:      to,
            Message: "Your OTP code is 478201",
        })

        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }

        return data, nil
    }

    func main() {
        message, err := SendSMS("+1234567890")
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
            return
        }

        fmt.Println(message)
    }
    ```
