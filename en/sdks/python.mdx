    def send_sms(to: str):
        params: rewrite.Messages.SendOptions = {
            "to": to,
            "message": "Your OTP code is 478201",
        }
    
        return rewrite.messages.send(params)
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        message = send_sms("+1234567890")
        print(message)
    ```
