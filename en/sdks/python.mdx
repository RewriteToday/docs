## Before you start

- You need to have Python installed on your machine.
- You need to have a Rewrite API key with the permissions.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the SDK" titleSize="h2">
        To install the Python SDK, run the following command:
        
        ```bash
        pip install rewrite
        ```
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Send your SMS" titleSize="h2">
    Now, all you need to do is pass the message content and that's it!
    
    ```py main.py
    import os
    import rewrite
    
    rewrite.api_key = os.environ["REWRITE_API_KEY"]
    
    params: rewrite.Messages.SendOptions = {
        "to": "+1234567890",
        "message": "Your OTP code is 478201",
    }
    
    message = rewrite.messages.send(params)
    
    print(message)
    ```
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Interact with the API" titleSize="h3">
      You can also interact with the API with the SDK methods
      
      ```py webhooks.py
      import os
      import rewrite
    
      rewrite.api_key = os.environ["REWRITE_API_KEY"]
      
      params: rewrite.Webhooks.CreateOptions = {
          "name": "My Webhook",
          "events": ["sms.delivered"],
          "url": "https://example.com/webhook",
      }
      
      webhook = rewrite.webhooks.create(params)
      
      print(webhook)
      ```
      You can do everything with our SDK, keep exploring!
