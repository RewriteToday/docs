## What are the Remessage SDKs?

The **Remessage SDKs** (Software Development Kits) are official libraries that simplify communication with the Remessage API.  
They provide language-specific, ergonomic interfaces so you can integrate transactional SMS into your application quickly and safely—without dealing with low-level HTTP details.

The SDKs are designed to feel natural in each ecosystem while staying fully aligned with the underlying API.

<Card title="Why use the Remessage SDKs?" horizontal>
  * **Simplified integration**: Prebuilt methods for all core API endpoints
  * **Strong typing**: First-class type support where available
  * **Consistent error handling**: Unified error models across languages
  * **Lower learning curve**: No need to understand every API detail upfront
  * **Kept in sync**: SDKs are updated alongside new API features
