        ```bash npm
        npm install rewritejs
        ```
        
        ```bash yarn
        yarn add rewritejs
        ```
        
        ```bash pnpm
        pnpm add rewritejs
        ```
        
        ```bash bun
        bun install rewritejs
        ```
        
        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Set up REWRITE_API_KEY environment variable" titleSize="h3">
    Set up your Rewrite API key in your environment variables.
    
    ```text .env    
    REWRITE_API_KEY=rw...
    ```
    </Step>

    Now, all you need to do is pass the message content and that's it!
    
    ```ts sms.ts
      import { Rewrite } from 'rewritejs';

      const rewrite = new Rewrite(process.env.REWRITE_API_KEY);

      const { data, error } = await rewrite.messages.send({
        to: '+1234567890',
        message: 'Your OTP code is 478201',
      });
      
      if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
      }
      
      console.log(data);
    ```
