    ```csharp Program.cs
    using RewriteToday;

    var rewrite = new RewriteClient(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("REWRITE_API_KEY"));

    var message = await rewrite.Messages.SendAsync(new SendMessageOptions
    {
      To = "+1234567890",
      Message = "Your OTP code is 478201"
    });

    Console.WriteLine(message);
    ```
