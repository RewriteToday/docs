## Before you start

- You need Swift 5.9+ installed on your machine.
- You need a Rewrite API key with the required permissions.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the SDK" titleSize="h3">
        Add the Swift package dependency:

        ```swift Package.swift
        dependencies: [
          .package(url: "https://github.com/rewritetoday/swift-sdk", from: "1.0.0")
        ]
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set up REWRITE_API_KEY environment variable" titleSize="h3">
    Set up your Rewrite API key in your environment variables.

    ```text .env
    REWRITE_API_KEY=rw...
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Send your SMS" titleSize="h3">
    Now, all you need to do is pass the message content and that's it.

    ```swift main.swift
    import Foundation
    import RewriteSDK

    @main
    struct Main {
      static func main() async throws {
        let rewrite = Rewrite(apiKey: ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["REWRITE_API_KEY"] ?? "")

        let message = try await rewrite.messages.send(
          to: "+1234567890",
          message: "Your OTP code is 478201"
        )

        print(message)
      }
    }
    ```

    You can do everything with our SDK, keep exploring.
