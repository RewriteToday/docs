        To install the Ruby SDK, run:

        <CodeGroup>

        ```bash gem
        gem install rewrite-ruby
        ```

        ```ruby Bundler
        gem "rewrite-ruby"
        ```

    <Step title="Set up REWRITE_API_KEY environment variable" titleSize="h3">
    Set up your Rewrite API key in your environment variables.

    ```text .env
    REWRITE_API_KEY=rw...
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Send your SMS" titleSize="h3">
    Now, all you need to do is pass the message content and that's it.

    ```rb main.rb
    require "rewrite"

    rewrite = Rewrite::Client.new(api_key: ENV.fetch("REWRITE_API_KEY"))

    message = rewrite.messages.send(
      to: "+1234567890",
      message: "Your OTP code is 478201"
    )

    puts message
    ```
