## Before you start

- You need Kotlin/JVM installed on your machine.
- You need a Rewrite API key with the required permissions.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install the SDK" titleSize="h3">
        Add the Kotlin SDK dependency:

        ```kotlin build.gradle.kts
        dependencies {
          implementation("io.github.rewritetoday:rewrite-kotlin:x.y.z")
        }
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set up REWRITE_API_KEY environment variable" titleSize="h3">
    Set up your Rewrite API key in your environment variables.

    ```text .env
    REWRITE_API_KEY=rw...
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Send your SMS" titleSize="h3">
    Now, all you need to do is pass the message content and that's it.

    ```kt main.kt
    import com.rewritetoday.sdk.Rewrite
    import com.rewritetoday.sdk.models.messages.SendOptions

    fun main() {
      val rewrite = Rewrite(System.getenv("REWRITE_API_KEY"))

      val params = SendOptions(
        to = "+1234567890",
        message = "Your OTP code is 478201"
      )

      val message = rewrite.messages.send(params)
      println(message)
    }
    ```

    You can do everything with our SDK, keep exploring.
