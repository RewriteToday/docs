## Overview

Use CLI authentication to manage multiple local profiles and switch accounts quickly.

You can:

- log in with an API key
- start an OAuth login flow
- list saved profiles
- delete a profile
- switch active profile

## Login with API key (hardcoded key example)

```bash
rewrite login --name xx --key xxx
```

Replace `xx` and `xxx` with your real profile name and API key in production usage.

## Login with OAuth flow

```bash
rewrite login
```

This starts the OAuth browser flow and stores credentials under a profile with
random name.

## List profiles

```bash
profile list
```

Example output:

```text
default   active
team-dev
personal
```

## Delete a profile

```bash
profile delete <name>
```

<Warning>
Deleting a profile removes local saved credentials for that profile.
</Warning>

## Switch active profile

```bash
rewrite switch <name>
```

Example:

```bash
rewrite switch dev
```

## Troubleshooting

- Invalid API key: verify key value and permissions.
- OAuth flow not opening: check browser defaults and callback handling.
- Profile not found: run `profile list` and confirm the exact profile name.
