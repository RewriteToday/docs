`@rewritejs/types` centralizes Rewrite API contracts so your integrations stay consistent across services and packages.

Repository: [github.com/RewriteToday/types](https://github.com/RewriteToday/types)

## What is included

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Routes" icon="signs-post" color="#C9CBD1">
    Route builders such as `Routes.apiKeys.create(projectId)`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enums" icon="list" color="#C9CBD1">
    Shared enums for scopes, event types, statuses, and domain constants.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Model contracts" icon="brackets-curly" color="#C9CBD1">
    Request and response interfaces used across Rewrite SDKs and tooling.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Utility types" icon="wrench" color="#C9CBD1">
    Reusable helper types for stronger compile-time guarantees.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Install

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @rewritejs/types
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @rewritejs/types
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @rewritejs/types
```

```bash bun
bun add @rewritejs/types
```
</CodeGroup>

## Route builder example

```ts
import { Routes } from '@rewritejs/types';

const listRoute = Routes.apiKeys.list('748395130237498368');
const createRoute = Routes.apiKeys.create('748395130237498368');

console.log({ listRoute, createRoute });
```

## Enum example

```ts
import { APIKeyScope, WebhookEventType } from '@rewritejs/types';

const scopes = [APIKeyScope.ReadTemplates, APIKeyScope.ReadWebhooks];
const events = [WebhookEventType.SMSDelivered, WebhookEventType.SMSFailed];

console.log({ scopes, events });
```

## Why use it even without REST?

- Keeps string literals out of business code.
- Improves refactoring safety in large codebases.
- Makes route and contract drift visible during code review.
- Standardizes API usage across teams and services.

<Info>
Using `@rewritejs/types` with `@rewritejs/rest` keeps request paths, enums, and payload contracts aligned end-to-end.
