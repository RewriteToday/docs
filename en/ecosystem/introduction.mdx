The Rewrite ecosystem is a set of focused packages designed to work together.
Use them independently or combine them for a typed, resilient integration stack.

## Ecosystem architecture

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Contracts" icon="code" color="#C9CBD1">
    `@rewritejs/types` provides shared enums, route builders, and payload contracts.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Transport" icon="route" color="#C9CBD1">
    `@rewritejs/rest` gives low-level HTTP control with Rewrite route helpers.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Product layer" icon="package" href="/en/sdks/introduction" color="#C9CBD1">
    SDKs build on top for higher-level language-native workflows.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Package catalog

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="@rewritejs/rest" icon="route" href="./rest" color="#C9CBD1">
    For explicit request control, retries, timeouts, hooks, and custom runtime behavior.
  </Card>

  <Card title="@rewritejs/types" icon="code" href="./types" color="#C9CBD1">
    For shared API contracts, route definitions, enums, and safer compile-time checks.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Which package should I use?

<Accordion title="I want fast integration with less boilerplate">
  Start with the official SDKs. They provide higher-level APIs and are usually the fastest path for product teams.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I need full HTTP/runtime control">
  Use `@rewritejs/rest`, optionally combined with `@rewritejs/types` for typed routes and payloads.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I only need contracts and route builders">
  Use `@rewritejs/types` by itself when you already have your own HTTP client or framework abstraction.
</Accordion>

## Design principles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Composable" icon="boxes-stacked" color="#C9CBD1">
    Each package has a clear role. Adopt only what your architecture needs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent" icon="badge-check" color="#C9CBD1">
    Shared route names and models reduce integration drift between services.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Production-ready" icon="shield-check" color="#C9CBD1">
    Built for retries, rate limits, and operational safety in real workloads.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open source" icon="github" color="#C9CBD1">
    Public repositories with transparent evolution and release history.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Repositories and references

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="REST repository" icon="github" href="https://github.com/RewriteToday/rest" color="#C9CBD1">
    Source code, releases, changelog, and issue tracker for `@rewritejs/rest`.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Types repository" icon="github" href="https://github.com/RewriteToday/types" color="#C9CBD1">
